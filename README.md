iomb - input-output model builder
=================================
iomb is a package for creating environmentally extended input-output models. 

Installation
------------
The installation of the package requires that [Python >= 3.4](https://docs.python.org/3/using/) 
is installed on your system. Unzip the source code and navigate via the command line to the 
source code folder:

```bash
    cd iomb
```

Then you can install it and its dependencies by creating an egg-link with pip:    
 
```bash
    pip install -e .
```

After this you should be able to use the `iomb` package in your Python script
files. If you want to use it in [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) you
have to install Jupyter too (via `pip install jupyter`). 

> (We plan to also publish this package on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi)
>  when this is ready you will be able to install the package via
   `pip install iomb`)   

To uninstall the package run

```bash
    pip uninstall iomb
```
