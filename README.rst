iomb - input-output model builder
=================================
iomb is a package for creating environmentally extended input-output models. 

Installation
------------
The installation of the package requires that Python >= 3.4 is 
`installed <https://docs.python.org/3/using/>`_ on your system. Unzip the source
code and navigate via the command line to the source code folder:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd iomb

Then you can install it and its dependencies by creating an egg-link with pip:    
 
.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e .

After this you should be able to use the `iomb` package in your Python script
files. If you want to use it in `Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org/>`_ you
have to install Jupyter too (via `pip install jupyter`). 

To uninstall the package run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip uninstall iomb
